Title: Memory Mapped Matrices and Data Structures for Genomic Data
Description: Genetic data can be very large and often holding data in RAM is
    not feasible. In a Memory Mapped File the actual data is stored on the HD.
    The ff R package implements memory mapped arrays and provides a very fast
    implementation of indexing operations, this allows accessing cells of the
    array almost at the same speed as accessing those cells in a regular matrix
    object (held in RAM). However, with ff the array size is limited by the
    largest integer supported by the system; with genomic data we often exceed
    this. Therefore we are developing new classes (rmmMatrix and cmmMatrix)
    which are essentially collections of ff objects. In these classes we
    distribute a matrix either by rows (rmmMatrix) or columns (cmmMatrix) into
    multiple ff objects. We have developed indexing and many other methods that
    allows the user to deal with these objects as if they were regular
    matrices. In addition we have developed methods that can take rmmMatrix or
    cmmMatrix as input to compute genomic relationship matrices, etc. The
    classes cmmMatrix and rmmMatrix were designed to hold genotype data
    (integer coding), the class BGData contains three slots @geno, @map and
    @pheno and can be used to hold GWAS data.
