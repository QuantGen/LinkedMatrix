\title{Creates a new \code{\link[=RowLinkedMatrix-class]{RowLinkedMatrix}} instance.}
\usage{
\S4method{initialize}{RowLinkedMatrix}(.Object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.Object}{The \code{\link[=RowLinkedMatrix-class]{RowLinkedMatrix}} 
instance to be initialized. This argument is passed in by R and can be
ignored, but still needs to be documented.}

\item{...}{A sequence of matrix-like objects of the same column-dimension.}
}
\description{
This constructor accepts a list of matrix-like objects as \code{...}. A 
matrix-like object is one that has two dimensions and implements at least 
\code{dim} and \code{[}. Each object needs to have the same number of columns
to be linked together. If no matrix-like objects are given, a single 1x1 node
of type \code{matrix} filled with \code{NA} is returned.
